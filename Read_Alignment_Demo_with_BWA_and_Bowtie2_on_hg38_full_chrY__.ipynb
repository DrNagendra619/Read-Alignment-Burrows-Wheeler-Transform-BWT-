This is consistent with the sequence not being reliably mapped. If it had mapped, this field would describe how the sequence matched the reference (e.g., how many bases matched, how many were inserted or deleted, or soft-clipped).\n","\n","5.  **Differences (Edit Distance - NM Tag):**\n","    - Both tools reported the Edit Distance (NM) as `N/A`.\n","    - The NM tag tells you the number of differences (substitutions, insertions, or deletions) between the sequence and the spot it mapped to on the chromosome.\n","    - Since the sequence didn't reliably map, neither tool could calculate an edit distance.\n","\n","**Overall Conclusion:**\n","\n","Adding 5 unknown 'N' bases randomly into our 50-base sequence prevented both BWA-MEM and Bowtie2 from confidently and uniquely mapping the sequence back to its original location on Chromosome Y. Both tools indicated a failure to map the sequence reliably, which is reflected in the '0' position, '0' mapping quality, and lack of detailed alignment (CIGAR `*`, NM `N/A`). This highlights how ambiguous bases ('N's) can affect the ability of alignment tools to precisely locate short sequences."]}]}
